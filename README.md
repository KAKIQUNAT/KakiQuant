# KakiQuant - Your personalized quantitative analysis platform

KakiQuant Project aims to provide an AI-ready toolkit for Quant developers and a minimalistic web interface for traditional traders to keep the pace of AI-Quant-Trading.

Features include:
- Datasource service that can provide completed financial data at low cost, and local Databases to enjoy low latency streaming
- Ready for AI, we will setup a framework where traditional ML toolkits, DNN-based solutions, and innovative models are introduced by Quant journals.
- Easy to use, we will finally provide high-level wrappers, such as flowcharts, that people can drag blocks and assemble a strategy.


## Developing Progress
This project is currently in the early stages, we are continuously adding more features and making the code base more robust.
We will always maintain a publicly available branch for developers. In KakiQuant, you are able to find:
- Profitable Strategies
- Daily advice
- AI portfolio management
- More ...

## Basic Features
- Datafeeding: Downloading, Cleaning, Reading, Updating
- Factor Analysis: Single Factor validation, Multi-Factor model, Barra, etc
- Basic ML: K-Means, Lightgbm, Gplearn, Graph Neural Networks, Hidden Markov Models...

## Advanced Features
- RL: Portfolio Management(MARL)
- DL: Time-series models

## Getting Started

```
# We recommend you to create a conda environment in case of any incompatibilities

# Our code is developed on python3.10
conda create -n quant python=3.10
cd /path_to_Kakiquant
pip install -e . # For developers
```

## Features
The following is a list of some of the features. Expect to see this list grow as we continuously work on implementing new features!

- Similarity Klines to get the most correlated indexes to the target.
- Graph Neural Network to generate a list of the 10 most similar indexes
- Hidden Markov Model.
- Access the data through our Database

## Reporting Issues

We value your contributions and strive to make the process of reporting issues as smooth as possible. If you encounter a problem or have a suggestion, please follow these guidelines to help us address your concerns effectively.

### Before Reporting an Issue

- **Check Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, please check already existing ones, to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. Make sure to check closed issues as well.
- **Gather Information**: Collect as much information as possible about the issue. This could include steps to reproduce the problem, the version of the software you're using, and relevant configuration details.
- **Attempt to Reproduce**: If you encounter a bug, try to reproduce it consistently. If the issue is intermittent, provide details about how often and under what conditions it occurs.

### How to Report a New Issue

1. **Use the Issue Template**: Determine what is wrong and why. Head to the issue section of this repository.

2. **Describe the Bug/Feature**: Clearly describe the issue you are experiencing or the feature you are proposing. Include any error messages, stack traces, screenshots, or other artifacts that would be helpful.

3. **Steps to Reproduce**: If applicable, provide a step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the bug.

4. **Expected Behavior**: Describe what you expected to happen when you encountered the bug.

5. **Actual Behavior**: Describe what happened. Include any error messages or unexpected outcomes.

6. **Possible Solution**: If you have an idea of how to fix the bug or implement the feature, suggest it here.

7. **Additional Context**: Add any other context about the problem or feature request here. This might include the impact of the issue, workarounds you have tried, or links to similar issues.

### After Reporting an Issue

- **Patience is Key**: After you submit an issue, the maintainers will need time to investigate and respond. We appreciate your patience as we work to resolve your issue.
- **Follow-Up**: You may be asked to provide
